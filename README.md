# Shooting Cuties
My First Unity Game!

- Enemies use Unity's built-in AI Path Finder Algorithm to chase Player
- Spawner uses algorithm which spawn enemies near the player
- Map generator script which helps to make different sizes, colors and obstacle placements on map from inspector.
- Obstacle generator uses algorithm which keeps it from fully blocking any area of map.
